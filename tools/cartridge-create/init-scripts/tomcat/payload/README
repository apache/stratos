This folder is a sample payload sent to a php instance when it is created.


Replace the values in launch_params file with correct values of your environment.

Now pack this payload as payload.zip and pass this when creating php instances.


Following is the /etc/rc.local file of the php instance

#!/bin/sh -e
/opt/wso2-openstack-init.sh > /var/log/wso2-openstack-init.log
exit 0

By the time rc.local file is invokded in the newly created tomcat instance, the payload is already
passed to the instance and reside in /var/lib/cloud/instance/payload

You can see that rc.local invoke the wso2-openstack-init.sh script in the payload.
