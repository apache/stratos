<h1>The WSO2 Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) 2.0.5 Release - 12th June 2013!</h1>

<p>
    The WSO2 ELB team is pleased to announce the release of version 2.0.5 of
    the Open Source Elastic Load Balancer (ELB).
</p>

<p>
    WSO2 ELB is a fast, lightweight and user friendly open source Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
    distributed under the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">Apache
    Software License v2.0</a>. WSO2 ELB allows system administrators and developers to
    easily configure fail over routing, load balancing, service aware load balancing, 
    tenant aware load balancing and dynamic load balancing with auto scaling.The ELB runtime 
    is designed to be completely asynchronous, non-blocking and streaming based on the 
    <a href="http://synapse.apache.org">Apache Synapse</a> mediation engine.
</p>

<p>
    WSO2 ELB 2.0.5 is developed on top of the revolutionary
    <a href="http://wso2.org/projects/carbon">WSO2 Carbon platform</a> (Middleware a' la carte),
    an OSGi based framework that provides seamless modularity to your SOA via
    componentization. This release also contains many new features and a range of optional
    components (add-ons) that can be installed to customize the behavior of the ELB. Further, any
    existing features of the ELB which are not required to your environment can be easily
    removed using the underlying provisioning framework of Carbon. In brief, WSO2 ELB can
    be fully customized and tailored to meet your exact SOA needs.
</p>

<p>
    You can download this distribution from <a href="http://wso2.com/products/elastic-load-balancer/">
    http://wso2.com/products/elastic-load-balancer/</a> our product page and give it a try.</p>

<h2>How to Run </h2>
<ol>
  <li>Extract the downloaded zip</li>
  <li>Go to the bin directory in the extracted folder</li>
  <li>Run the wso2server.sh or wso2server.bat as appropriate</li>
  <li>Configure the load balancer to manage the load across the instances to be balanced.</li>
  <li>If you need to start the OSGi console with the server use the property
    -DosgiConsole when starting the server. The INSTALL.txt file found on the
    installation directory will give you a comprehensive set of options and
    properties that can be passed into the startup script</li>
</ol>

<h2>Key Features of WSO2 ELB</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Non-blocking HTTP/S transports based on Apache HttpCore-NIO for ultra-fast
   execution and support for thousands of connections at high concurrency with
   constant memory usage. Integrated high performing, Passthrough Transport.</li>
  <li>Load-balancing (with or without sticky sessions)/Fail-over, and clustered
   Throttling and Caching support</li>
  <li>Lightweight, XML and Web services centric messaging model</li>
  <li>Automatically scaling the system according to the number of requests in-flight for 
   a particular service cluster - "Scale up early, scale down slowly"
  </li>
  <li>Service aware dynamic load balancing - A single load balancer
   can centrally manage the load across the nodes of different service clusters.
  </li>
  <li>Tenant aware load balancing - Tenants can be loaded and unloaded dynamically.
   Tenants can be partitioned to different service clusters.
</ul>

        <li>LB-31 - No response code in the access log.</li>
        <li>LB-37 - Browser tries to save the page sent via LB time to time rather than display it.</li>
        <li>LB-51 - Disable management console in LB and do not print mgmt console URL at startup.</li>
        <li>LB-52 - When member leaves the cluster, session continued to bind to that cluster member.</li>
        <li>LB-55 - Make autoscaling algorithm configurable.</li>
