      <h2>Starting external zoo keeper server and use the inbuilt cassandra server in ring model with broker nodes</h2>
      <p>
          In this model you need to get downloaded following apache product
      </p>

      <ul>
          <li><a href=" http://zookeeper.apache.org/releases.html#download">Apache Zoo Keeper</a> <p> Version 3.3.4</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p> Deployment model will be like bellow </p>
      <p>
          <img src="images/cluster_scenario_02.png" alt="Cluster Setup Scenario 02" height="600" width ="950"/>
      </p>
      <p> In this model we have a common zoo keeper server. Since we are shipping a cassandra server with Message broker product we can
          use that and create a cassandra ring in the cluster.</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Zoo Keeper Server - 192.168.0.100</li>
      </ul>
      <p> We have three Message Broker servers in three different hosts as and all of them are having a cassandra server in it</p>
       <ul>
          <li>MB Server 01 - 192.168.0.101</li>
          <li>MB Server 02 - 192.168.0.102</li>
          <li>MB Server 03 - 192.168.0.103</li>
      </ul>

      <p> We need to configure cassandra servers in these MB servers to form a cassandra ring. For that we need to change the following
          entries in the "Cassandra.yaml" file which is located in the "wso2mb-2.0.1/repository/conf/etc" directory.</p>

      <ul>
          <li>Change the seeds in the ring. You can get a better idea on setting a cassandra from following <a href="http://www.datastax.com/docs/1.0/install/cluster_init">web page.</a>
          Here we are configuring two seed nodes. (MB Server 01 and 02)</li>

          <pre>
              # seeds is actually a comma-delimited list of addresses.
              # Ex: "&lt;ip1>,&lt;ip2>,&lt;ip3>"
              - seeds: "192.168.0.101,192.168.0.102"

          </pre>

          <li>Change listen address of the server. By default it is "localhost", change it to the ip address of the host where you
          have the cassandra server. <b>You need to change the listen address of the each server to it's ip address. Here
          for the server 192.168.0.102, it will like bellow. </b>
          </li>
          <pre>
             listen_address: 192.168.0.102
          </pre>

          <li>Change RPC address of the server.By default it is "localhost", change it to the ip address of the host where you
          have the cassandra server. <b>You need to change the RPC address of the each server to it's ip address. Here
          for the server 192.168.0.103, it will like bellow. </b></li>
           <pre>
             rpc_address: 192.168.0.103
          </pre>
      </ul>

      <p> Then we need to configure the Zoo Keeper Server to listen to all broker nodes. We can do it by renaming the "zoo_sample.cfg"
      file which can be found at "zookeeper-3.3.4/conf" folder to "zoo.cfg" and do the following modification in that file
      </p>

      <ul>
          <li>Change the data directory to store data local to the installation directory</li>
          <li>Add the entry "clientPortAddress" by providing the ip of the localhost</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After modifying the file , it will look like bellow. </p>
      <pre>
            # The number of milliseconds of each tick
            tickTime=2000
            # The number of ticks that the initial
            # synchronization phase can take
            initLimit=10
            # The number of ticks that can pass between
            # sending a request and getting an acknowledgement
            syncLimit=5
            # the directory where the snapshot is stored.
            dataDir=./../data
            # the port at which the clients will connect
            clientPort=2181

            clientPortAddress=192.168.0.100
        </pre>
      <p>
          Once you done the above changes, you can save the file and start the zookeeper server by executing the "zkServer.sh" script
          with the option start. eg: sh zkServer.sh start
      </p>

      <p>
          Then you need to do the following configuration changes in each Message broker nodes
      </p>
      <p>
         Modify qpid-config.xml file which is located at : /repository/conf/advanced directory as bellow
      </p>
      <ul>

          <li>Enable clustering</li>
          <li>Change the server of the Zookeeper</li>
      </ul>
      <pre>
          &lt;clustering>

          &lt;enabled><b>true</b>&lt;/enabled>
          &lt;OnceInOrderSupportEnabled>false&lt;/OnceInOrderSupportEnabled>
          &lt;externalCassandraServerRequired>false&lt;/externalCassandraServerRequired>

          &lt;coordination>
              &lt;!-- Apache Zookeeper Address -->
              &lt;ZooKeeperConnection><b>192.168.0.100</b>:2181&lt;/ZooKeeperConnection>
              &lt;!-- Format yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss -->
              &lt;ReferenceTime>2012-02-29 08:08:08&lt;/ReferenceTime>
          &lt;/coordination>
      </pre>

      <p>Now you can start all three Message Broker nodes.</p>
