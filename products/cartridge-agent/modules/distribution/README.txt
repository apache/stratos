Welcome to the Apache Stratos Cartridge Agent

Cartridge Agent is a component that resides within a cartridge instance and handles the communication between the
cartridge and Stratos. Cartridge Agent communicates with Message Broker to publish its state and manage the cartridge
lifecycle. Furthermore, it talks to Complex Event Processor (CEP) to send health statistics of the cartridge. Cartridge
Agent is generic and can be used in any  cartridge. A Cartridge Agent comprises of the following components as
illustrated in the following diagram: Instance Notifier Event Receiver, Health Statistics Publisher, Artifact Deployment
Synchronizer and Instance Status Event Publisher.
