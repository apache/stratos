<h1>The WS-Policy Editor</h1>
The
WS-Policy Editor allows you to edit WS-Policy documents using either a
graphical editor or a plain text editor. Given a Service or a Module,
it will
generate a graphical tree view (Policy Tree) representing the document
along with the plain text (Raw Policy) representation. The default view presented is the source view or the raw policy.<ol> 

</ol>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>: You
will be editing the merged WS-Policy, which includes all
the WS-Policy components attached to the level selected.</div>
<ol>

<br/><br/>The
WS-Policy Editor also contains a Design View (experimental), which
provides a graphical representation of the WS-Policy in question.<br/><img src="images/policy-editor-design-view.png" alt="policy-editor-design-view.png"/>




</ol>
<ul>
<li>Using the Policy Editor</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Right-click on any node in the policy tree. A shortcut
menu appears.
You can add new elements and
delete existing ones. The plain text representation will be kept in
sync with the changes done using the Policy Tree, and vise versa. 
</li>

Selecting
an element in the Policy Tree allows you to edit the attributes of that
policy element. Similarly, when adding an element, you will be prompted
to add data to the attributes relevant to that particular element.

<li>Once you have finished editing
your policy document, click <span style="font-weight: bold;">Save Policy</span>.</li>
<li>Click <span style="font-weight: bold;">Go
Back</span> to go back to the previous page.
</li>

</ol>
