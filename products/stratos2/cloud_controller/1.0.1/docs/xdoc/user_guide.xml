        <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction to Message Broker</h2>
        <p>This gives a brief introduction of how message broker can be used
            in publishing and receiving messages.
        </p>

        <p>
            WSO2 Message Broker is basically consist of two major features.They are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pub/ Sub Feature</li>
            <li>Message Broker Clustering feature</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
            Pub/Sub Feature
        </h3>

        <p>This feature of the WSO2 Message Broker provides the facility for users to route messages
            to the required users. If we are explaining deeply,
            there is a concept called 'Topic' and message routing is done on the base of that
            topic. When a particular user want to publish
            a message to a particular sector , he creates a topic with a name related to the
            messages that he is going to pulish. As an example, if a particular
            user want to publish messages related with sports news, he can create a topic with the
            name 'SportsNews' and publish the messages to that topic.
        </p>

        <p>
            When another particular user is interested on any topic in the topic tree, he can
            subscribe to that topic and receive messages which are published
            to that topic by the publisher. As in the above example, when a particular user is
            interested on sports, he can subscribed to the topic 'SportsNews'
            and get messages published to that topic.
        </p>

        <h3>How to use Pub/Sub Feature</h3>

        <p>In WSO2 Message Broker , Pub/Sub feature is one of the two major features. Inorder to use
            this feature , it is needed to create a Topic and subscribe to it.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Step 01</li>

                <img src="images/topic_browser_clicked.png"
                     alt="Topic Details"/>
            </p>


            <p>Once you click on 'Subscribe' link on the above page, you will be directed to Add
                subscriptions page.
            </p>

            <p>
                <img src="images/topic_addSubscription.png"
                     alt="Subscribe to topics"/>
            </p>

            <p>You can create a subscription to the topic by provide the information on subscription
            </p>
            <li>Topic</li>
            <p>User does not need to specify the topic here , since its automatically sets up.</p>

            <li>Subscription Mode</li>

            <p>This is the mode of the subscription and there are three modes.</p>

            <p>The default mode for the subscription is "Topic Only". With this mode , user creates
                the
                subscription only to the topic. In this mode subscribers only receive events which
                are published only to the that topic.
            </p>

            <p>Next mode of subscription is "Topic and Immediate child". In this mode subscribers of
                the topic
                receives events published not only the specified topic but also to the immediate
                child of that topic.
            </p>

            <p>Last mode of subscription is "Topic and Children". In this mode subscribers of the
                specified
                topic will receive events published to the specified topic and all its children
            </p>

            <li>Event Sink URL</li>
            <p>This is the URL which the subscriber should provide to receive events published. When
                events are
                published to the topic, they are sent to the specified URL here.
            </p>

            <li>Expiration Time</li>
            <p>Here user can specify the expiration time of the subscription. This is not a required
                parameter and
                if user leave it alone, subscription will never be expired.
            </p>

            <p>Note : You can create a simple axis2service and use it's URL as the EventSinkURL .
                Inorder to create an axis2service ,
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Browse the location : /wso2mb-1.0.0/samples/services/EventSinkService
                </li>
                <li>Type the command : ant</li>

                <P>(This ant task will create a simple axis2service 'EventSinkService' and deploy it
                    in the location :
                    /wso2mb-1.0.0/repository/deployment/server/axis2services/ )
                </P>
            </ul>

            <p>Now you can create a subscription by providing the Event Sink URL :
                https://localhost:9443/services/EventSinkService/getOMElement
            </p>

            <p>Click on the button 'Subscribe' and it will create the subscription and list it in
                the subscription table of that topic in topic details page.
            </p>


            <p>
                <img src="images/topic_subscriptionDetails.png"
                     alt="Topic subscription details"/>
            </p>


            <li>Step 05</li>

            <p>At the end of the subscribing process , you can test whether the topic and the
                subscriptions created are working fine.
                In order to do that what you have to do is type a XML message in the provided text
                box and under the 'Publish' section
                of Topic Details page and click on 'Publish button'
            </p>

            <p>Then check the command line and you will be able to see the XML Message that you
                types in the provided space.
            </p>
            <h3>Clustering support of WSO2 Message Broker</h3>
            <p>
            	WSO2 MB  is now supporting clustering. That means high availability and failover support
            	is there. You can setup several Message Broker nodes and configure them up to work as a cluster 
            	so that if one node is down message routing and handling will be taken over by other nodes in the cluster.
            	At the same time overhead of routing messages is distributed among the Message Broker cluster nodes so
            	that overall performance of Message Brokering goes up. Thus, having a lot of publishers and subscribers will
            	not be a problem anymore as there is no significant performance degrade with the number of publishers, 
            	subscribers and exchanges. Scalability is beyond you with WSO2 MB with combined resources you have. 
            	Fault tolerance brings you great benefits in deployment apart from the performance gain. 
            </p>

            <p>
                There are several cluster deployment models supported by WSO2 Message Broker. Read on them at <a href="deployment_guide.html">
                Deployment guide
                </a>
                and choose the suitable deployment pattern for your use-case and enable clustering as described there.
            </p>

            <li>   Sample Scenario - This sample is based on Clustering Scenario 1, <a href="cluster_scenario_01.html">'Starting external cassandra server
                   and zoo keeper server and point all broker nodes to them'</a>:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In your local machine setup two WSO2 MB instances running with external Cassandra server and Zookeeper server
                        (note that you can setup Cassandra and Zookeeper to run on the same machine). In order to do that in the second WSO2 MB
                        instance define a port offset changing &lt;MB Home&gt;/repository/conf/carbon.xml (eg: set port offset to 1).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We will call first broker instance MB1 (runs on port 5672) and the other MB2 (runs on port 5673).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Using following JMS client make subscriptions to a queue "myQueue" at MB1.

                        Now you can run the consumer to receive messages from MB1. You will notice that the message you have
                        sent to MB2 can be received by MB1. Even if MB2 instance was destroyed message will be consumed to the consumer.
